// The Docker watch: what happens to an app's containers when nobody asked for it.
//
// A crash, a failing health check or a restart loop goes through no operation that would
// report it, and it is what the owner wants to hear about away from the dashboard. The
// watch follows Docker's events for the containers of the compose projects -- the apps --
// and publishes four events, which the core's alerts turn into messages. What an event
// means is decided by observe and tick, pure over the events and the Begin registry, so
// that the decisions are tested without a daemon:
//
//  1. a die with a non-zero exit code is app:container-died, unless an operation holds
//     the app or somebody asked for the stop;
//  2. health_status: unhealthy is app:container-unhealthy, held or not: an operation that
//     ends leaves it unhealthy, and Docker says so only once;
//  3. more than restartsForALoop starts of a container within watchWindow, none of them
//     asked for nor an operation's, is app:container-restarting, once an episode;
//  4. after those, every troubled container of the app running and not unhealthy for
//     watchWindow is app:container-healthy, once for the app, which ends the episode:
//     the core's alert is the app's, not a container's.
