// Putting an app back from a backup.
//
// The backup's manifest says what is there. It does not say where any of it goes:
// the host paths it carries are where things were on the box that took it, which
// may be this box a year ago or another box entirely, and a manifest is a file
// on a remote that anyone with the credentials can edit. So the places to put
// things back are worked out here, from the app as it is installed now, exactly
// the way a backup works them out -- and the manifest's paths are never used as
// a destination for anything. What the two plans have in common is restored;
// what the backup holds and the app no longer declares is reported, not written
// somewhere it was not asked for.
