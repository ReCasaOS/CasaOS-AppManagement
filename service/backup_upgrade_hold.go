// What the box does by itself and an operating system upgrade do not mix: dpkg rewrites the
// system underneath a backup, a build or a start, and the upgrade stops and starts the
// containers they work on as well.
//
// While an upgrade is open the core keeps this file, from the click that starts it until it
// is closed, which includes the days a finished run can wait for its restart. Only the core
// writes it, and it is read here for its existence alone: asking whether it is there needs no
// more than the right to look into its directory, which a service that is not root has.
//
// Held while it is there: the backups that go off by themselves, and the git apps' own
// work -- the check every five minutes, a push, and the deployment a check finds to do.
//
// Not held: what somebody clicks (a backup, a restore, a deployment, a check, which reads and
// whose deployment waits), the checks of the images (they only read the registries; an image
// is updated by a click and by nothing else), and what a start of this service puts back
// (the containers a backup left stopped, the apps a restart found stopped before the storage
// was there): they undo something, and held they would leave an app off.

// osUpgradeBusyPath is the file; the core and this service agree on the name. A variable
// so a test can look at a file of its own with everything else as production wires it.

// still something put there, and the core reads it the same way.
