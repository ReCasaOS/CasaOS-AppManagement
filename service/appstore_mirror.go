// The catalogue's mirror.
//
// The App Store is IceWhale's catalogue, fetched as a zip: since February 2025
// the artifact IceWhaleTech/CasaOS-AppStore builds on its gh-pages branch,
// served through jsdelivr, and before that a zip of the IceWhaleTech/_appstore
// repository, which a box installed then and upgraded since may still name in
// its configuration. The day the source goes away, every box keeps the copy it
// already has and never sees an update again, and a fresh install gets the seed
// the installer ships and nothing after. This distribution keeps a copy of the
// artifact, refreshed every night (github.com/ReCasaOS/_appstore); when the
// original stops answering, the copy is fetched instead. The configured URL is
// not changed, on disk or in the dashboard: the original is still the source,
// and it is tried first on every update.

// mirrorZip is this distribution's copy of the catalogue: the same bytes as
// IceWhale's store/main.zip, taken every night.
