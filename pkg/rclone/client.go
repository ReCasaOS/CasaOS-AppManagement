// which means S3, SFTP, FTP, the retries, the resume after a broken connection and
// the incremental comparison are already here, already running, and already driven
// over an API. None of that is worth writing again in Go.

// credentials. It listens with --rc-no-auth, so any local process can read and
// write every remote it holds; that is already true of the cloud drives CasaOS
// stores there today. And it is pinned at v1.61.1, which is old but long predates
// every backend used here.
